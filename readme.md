# Not Maintained
I develop this library years ago and currently developing this library is not a priority. 
So if there is a bug or future request, you may look at other library or submit a PR.
Thank you.

# Summary:
I made this library with single purpose, to auto format number while user type arbitrary number.
For example:
150000 -> 15,000.
276000800.50 -> 276,000,800.50

While this is easy to achieve using simple format, I find it challenging when you involve user interaction (on EditText), especially after inserting or deleting a text. With this library user can type money on EditText without worrying it will not incorrectly formatted.

# Demo:
[![AutoFormat in Action](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8Ef79UqwHfk/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ef79UqwHfk)

# Usage:
add this on your app level gradle

```compile 'com.aldoapps:autoformatedittext:0.9.3'```

# Example
See sample app to see it in action. It's very simple, just apply AutoFormatEditText like an EditText on your layout
```xml
<com.aldoapps.autoformatedittext.AutoFormatEditText
android:layout_width="match_parent"
android:layout_height="wrap_content"
app:isDecimal="true"
android:maxLength="10"/>
```
By default this doesn't support Decimal input, to enable decimal input use ```app:isDecimal="true"``` on its attribute. Value after Decimal will not be auto formatted. You can also use all TextView's attribute like maxLength to limit user input.

# Feature:
- Thousands separated number auto-format
- Value after dots will not be formatted i.e  732,000.502816
- Support with or without decimal formatting
- Various input restriction (Soft input keyboard and max length)

# You may find this library useful for:
- Calculator app
- Banking / Finance app
- Any app that involve auto formatting
